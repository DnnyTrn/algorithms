Problem
  Given a list of jobs with their deadlines and penalties, design a greedy algorithm that schedules the jobs so that
  a minimal penalty is incurred. 
  
  In CLRS, this problem is called "scheduling unit-time tasks with deadlines and penalties for a single processor".
  Other variations of this problem "maximizes profit" instead of minimizing penalties.
