<h1> Problem </h1>
<p> Given a list of n integers, the product sum is the largest sum that can be formed by multiplying adjacent elements in the list. each element can be matched with at most one of it's neighbors.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Example given a list of 1, 2, 3, 1 the product-sum is 8 = 1 + (2*3) + 1 </li>
<li>Example: 1, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2 the product-sum is 29 = 1 + (4*3) + 2 (3*4) + 2  </li>
<li>Example: 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2 the product-sum is 19 = 2*2) + 1 + (3*2) + 1 + (2*2) + 1 + 2 </li>
</ul>
